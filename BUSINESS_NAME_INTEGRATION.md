# Business Name Integration with User Registration and Merchant Accounts

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented business name integration with user registration, automatically linking it to merchant account creation. All models are properly configured and displayed in Django admin.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced User Registration
- Added `business_name` field to `UserRegistrationSerializer`
- Optional field that can be used for merchant account creation
- Integrated with existing OTP verification system

### 2. Automatic Merchant Account Creation
Multiple scenarios supported:

#### Scenario 1: Business Name Only
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "password_confirm": "password123",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "business_name": "John's Coffee Shop",
  "create_merchant_account": true
}
```
**Result**: Creates merchant account with business name "John's Coffee Shop"

#### Scenario 2: Business Name + Detailed Merchant Data
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "password_confirm": "password123",
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Smith",
  "business_name": "Jane's Bakery",
  "create_merchant_account": true,
  "merchant_data": {
    "business_name": "Jane's Premium Bakery",
    "business_email": "business@example.com",
    "business_address": "123 Main St",
    "category": "category_id"
  }
}
```
**Result**: `merchant_data` takes precedence, creates "Jane's Premium Bakery"

#### Scenario 3: No Business Name (Fallback)
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "password_confirm": "password123",
  "first_name": "Bob",
  "last_name": "Wilson",
  "create_merchant_account": true
}
```
**Result**: Creates merchant account with business name "Bob Wilson"

#### Scenario 4: Business Name without Merchant Creation
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "business_name": "Alice's Store",
  "create_merchant_account": false
}
```
**Result**: Business name stored but no merchant account created

### 3. Django Admin Integration

#### All Models Registered:
- ✅ **CustomUser** (`/admin/authentication/customuser/`)
- ✅ **Merchant** (`/admin/authentication/merchant/`)
- ✅ **MerchantCategory** (`/admin/authentication/merchantcategory/`)
- ✅ **EmailOTP** (`/admin/authentication/emailotp/`)

#### Merchant Admin Features:

- **Search Fields**: business_name, user email, business_email
- **Filters**: status, verification status, category, dates
- **Actions**: approve_merchants, reject_merchants, suspend_merchants

## 🗃️ Database Schema

### Updated Serializer Fields
```python
class UserRegistrationSerializer:
    fields = [
        'email', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'phone_number',
        'password', 'password_confirm', 'business_name',  # ← NEW
        'role', 'country', 'preferred_currency'
    ]
